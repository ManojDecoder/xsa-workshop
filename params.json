You can also upload/download the JSON file for editing locally.  This is useful for mass changes or copying of workshops.  The json can also be added to the csv file in the project so the content automatically loads upon installation. \r\n\r\nThis way the complete workshop can be transported with the MTAR, version controlled, etc.\r\n\r\nThe URL is the same for all the sites (/workshop/admin/ui/exerciseMaster/), you just pass the workshop id as a URL parameter (?workshop=XXX).\r\n\r\nYou can also use the node key for a particular step in the URL to position right to that template.\r\n\r\nIn your templates you can use placeholders like <group_number> . The web page looks for these patterns and takes the group number from the User Id and replaces in-line. Here are the strings it can replace. Let me know if there are others you would need:\r\n\r\n    var parts = gUserName.split(\"_\");\r\n    var grpNumber = parts[1];\r\n    if (typeof(grpNumber) != 'undefined' && grpNumber != null){\r\n       myTXT = myTXT.replace(/<group number>/g,grpNumber);\r\n       myTXT = myTXT.replace(/<group_number>/g,grpNumber);  \r\n       myTXT = myTXT.replace(/<group>/g,grpNumber);           \r\n       myTXT = myTXT.replace(/<Your User>/g,gUserName);\r\n       }\r\n\r\nThis logic does require that you name your users in such a way that they end in _XXX where XXX is your group number.  For example DEV162_050.\r\n",
